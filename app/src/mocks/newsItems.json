    "text": "Out of all the beauty that Indonesia has to offer, Wayag is perhaps the most stunning spot, says Michael Travers, head of marketing and communications at SeaTrek Sailing Adventures.Wayag has hundreds of thickly forested limestone karsts and islands, resulting in sheltered bays with white sand beaches and coral reefs, he says.There arent any villages, let alone tourist accommodation, and guests can only really arrive by boat, adds Travers. I\'d definitely recommend climbing to the lookout point on the western side of the main Wayag Bay. It\'s not for the faint of heart (picture a 30-minute ascent through forest and over jagged limestone), but there are the most sgering views of paradise at the end.",
